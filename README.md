help me draft an email to a colleague to ask for assistance. Ka team is doing an end to end customer journey analysis trying to understand how customer register, upload a  device, enroll in service to license purchase. We want to understand when customers are aprroved, how do we send them the email, does it included a link/tutorial for next step( upload device). If they havent done anything after they are approved, do we have reminder emails sent to them. It would be nice if we can see such emails

Here’s a polished but friendly email draft you can use to reach out to your colleague for assistance:

Subject: Request for Support: Customer Journey Email Communications

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I hope you're doing well!

Our team is currently working on an end-to-end customer journey analysis, focusing on the full path from registration to device upload, service enrollment, and license purchase. As part of this effort, we're hoping to better understand the email communications customers receive—particularly at and after the point of approval.

Specifically, we’re looking to answer a few key questions:

Once a customer is approved, what kind of email do they receive?

Does that email include a link or tutorial guiding them on the next step (e.g., uploading a device)?

If a customer hasn’t taken any action post-approval, are there any reminder or follow-up emails sent to them?

It would be incredibly helpful if we could get visibility into these emails (even just examples or templates), so we can map the journey more accurately.

Would you be the right person to help with this, or could you point me to someone who might be?

Thanks so much in advance!

Best,
Tianchu
